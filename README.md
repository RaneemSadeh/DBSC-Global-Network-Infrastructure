# DBSC Global Network Infrastructure

A comprehensive design and simulation of a **secure**, **scalable**, and **resilient** global network for the **Digital Banking Service Company (DBSC)**. This project connects the **Amman HQ** with six **international branches** to ensure reliable communication, data exchange, and access to critical services.

All network design and simulation were built and tested using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## üåê Network Topology Overview

### Global WAN Connectivity
Connects the Amman Data Center to branches in:
- Istanbul
- Riyadh
- Dubai
- London
- Beirut
- Cairo

### Routing
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** implemented across the entire WAN for dynamic, scalable routing.

### Core Network Services (hosted in Amman HQ)
- **DHCP**: Automatic IP assignment
- **DNS**: Resolves `eis.DBSC.com.jo` to IPs
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Internal company web portal
- **SMTP/POP3**: Email services
- **FTP**: Secure file transfers

### Topologies
- **WAN**: Hub-and-spoke model with Amman as central hub
- **LAN**: Extended star topology within each branch for easy expansion and fault isolation

---

## üîê Security Features
- Router access secured with passwords
- Traffic segregation between sites and functions
- Device access limited by design

---

## üß† IP Addressing Schema
- Address space: `172.20.0.0/16`
- Methodology: **VLSM** for efficient IP utilization and growth planning

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Branch LAN Architecture
Each office includes:
- Floor-based central switches
- End-user devices: PCs, laptops, printers
- Wireless access via secure access points

_Optional: Insert screenshot of a single branch LAN design here_
